# Unbound config for localhost using DNS over TLS (DOT)

# Before using the config, ensure the the following parameters are set correctly:
## Install ca-certificates packages and set tls-cert-bundle
## Fetch root root hints from https://www.internic.net/domain/named.cache and set root-hints
## Set trust-anchor-file. Use the unbound-anchor program bundled with unbound
